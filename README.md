ðŸš€ My Goal
To become a backend + GenAI integration engineer, specializing in building intelligent APIs and scalable AI infrastructure using TypeScript and Python.

I aim to work with remote, high-growth startups (US, EU, or AU), or contribute to open source GenAI tooling (LangChain, vector DBs, orchestration frameworks).

I'm committed to production-grade engineering, clean system architecture, and shipping real-world, AI-powered backend solutions.
